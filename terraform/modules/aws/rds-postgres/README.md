# RDS PostgreSQL Module

Manages a PostgreSQL RDS instance plus its subnet group and security group. Designed for on-prem Greptile deployments that need a managed database with opinionated defaults but overridable sizing and security parameters. Automated backups are enabled by default with a 14-day retention window so customer data can be recovered well beyond the past week.
