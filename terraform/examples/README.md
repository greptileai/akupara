# Terraform Examples

This directory contains self-contained snippets that show how to consume the reusable stacks/modules shipped with the repo. Each example is meant to be copied into a customer-owned root module.

Current examples:
- `aws-ec2-module/` – demonstrates calling `terraform/stacks/aws-ec2` as a module from another root configuration.
